        Function that will be called every time a window is picked. This is part
        of the project so it can change depending on the project.

        Please keep in mind that you will have to manually update this file to a
        new version if LASIF is ever updated.

        You can do whatever you want in this function as long as the function
        signature is honored and the correct data types are returned. You could
        for example only tweak the window picking parameters but you could also
        implement your own window picking algorithm or call some other tool that
        picks windows.

        This function has to return a list of tuples of start and end times,
        each tuple denoting a selected window.
